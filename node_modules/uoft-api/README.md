A Node.js module which parses data from the University of Toronto's course listings into JSON to help developers create applications for students with ease.

#### Getting Started
##### Install:
```sh
$ npm i uoft-api
```
##### Reference:
```js
var uoftAPI = require('uoft-api');
```

### Supported Functions
- `getAllCourseDepartments`
- `getCourseDepartment`
- `getProgramCourses`

##### `getAllCourseDepartments(callback)`
- Takes a callback which handles error and an array of JSON objects, where each object contains a department field which has the name of the department specified by the code.

##### Number of Requests:
- `getAllCourseDepartments` performs **1** request to retrieve all department names.

##### Usage:
```js
uoftAPI.getAllCourseDepartments(function(err, allDepartments) {
  // do whatever with the course department array
});
```
##### Examples
```js
uoftAPI.getAllCourseDepartments(function(err, allDepartments) {
  console.log(allDepartments);
  /*
  [ { department: 'Aboriginal Studies' },
    { department: 'American Studies' },
    { department: 'Anatomy' },
      < ... etc, ordered by department name ... >
    { department: 'Victoria College Courses' },
    { department: 'Woodsworth College Courses' },
    { department: 'Women and Gender Studies' } ]
  ]
  */
});
```
##### `getCourseDepartment(courseCode, callback)`
- `courseCode` is a valid three-letter code representing a department at the University (ie/ the first three letters of any course code).
- Takes a `callback` which handles error and an array of JSON objects, where each object contains a department field which has the name of the department specified by the code.

##### Number of Requests:
- `getCourseDepartment` performs **1** request to retrieve the department name of the specified program.

##### Usage:
```js
uoftAPI.getCourseDepartment(programCode, function(err, department) {
  // do whatever with the course department array
});
```
##### Examples
```js
uoftAPI.getCourseDepartment('csc', function(err, department) {
  console.log(department);
  /* [ { department: 'Computer Science' } ] */
});
```

```js
uoftAPI.getCourseDepartment('env', function(err, department) {
  console.log(department);
  /* [ { department: 'Environment, School of' } ] */
});
```

##### `getProgramCourses(programCode, acceptCancelledCourses, callback)`
- Takes a valid three-letter `programCode` representing a department at the University (ie/ the first three letters of any  course code).
- Takes a value `true` or `false`, which determines whether cancelled courses will be included in the array of course JSON objects.
- Takes a callback which handles error and an array of courses represented as JSON objects (as demonstrated below), where each JSON object contains a single course's information and has the following structure:

```js
  {
    courseName: 'Computational Thinking', // Title of the course
    courseCode: 'CSC104H1',               // Course code
    courseTerm: 'F',                      // Course semester
    courseWait: 'Y',                      // If the course contains a wait-list (Y/N)
    courseProf: [ 'D. Heap' ]             // Professor(s) teaching the course
  }
```

##### Number of Requests:
- `getProgramCourses` performs **2** requests to retrieve all course data of the specified program.

##### Usage:
```js
uoftAPI.getProgramCourses(programCode, acceptCancelledCourses, function(err, courseData) {
  // do whatever with the returned courseData json
});
```
##### Examples
```js
uoftAPI.getProgramCourses('csc', true, function(err, courseData) {
  console.log(courseData);
  /*
  [
    {
      courseName: 'Computational Thinking',
      courseCode: 'CSC104H1',
      courseTerm: 'F',
      courseWait: 'Y',
      courseProf: [ 'D. Heap' ]
    },
    {
      courseName: 'Computational Thinking',
      courseCode: 'CSC104H1',
      courseTerm: 'S',
      courseWait: 'Y',
      courseProf: [ 'G. Baumgartner' ]
    },
      < ... etc, ordered by course code ... >
    {
      courseName: 'Computabil & Logic',
      courseCode: 'CSC438H1',
      courseTerm: 'F',
      courseWait: 'Y',
      courseProf: [ 'T. Pitassi' ]
    }
  ]
*/
});
```

### Function Addition Roadmap
- Extending `getProgramCourses` to include the lecture and tutorial sections of each respective class in their own arrays.
- Extending `getProgramCourses` to include when each tutorial and lecture section takes place (day of the week and time).
- Extending the module to support course data from the University of Toronto Mississauga and Scarborough campus time-tables.
- Extending the module to support course data from the St. George campus Faculty of Engineering.
